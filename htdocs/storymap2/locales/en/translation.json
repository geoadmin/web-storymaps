Urban sprawl increased rapidly in the period from 1935 to 2002, especially between 1960 and 1980. The most rapid increase was in the Central Plateau (Mittelland), followed by the Jura region, while the rates of development in the Central Alps and in the Northern and Southern Alps were considerably slower.
